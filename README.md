# This was my Schools finale project.  
It's a website connected with a MySql Database (which is no longer accesable) & the current graph of devices already taken.
The website would allow a user to request a certain device to be used in a certain timeframe & date. As well as for administrators to see what kind of devices are used & statiscis on them, such as use time & dates.

The website functions were split in two sides, the admin side & the user side.
